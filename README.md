# Problem Set 3:
The third problem sheet for my third year data representation and querying module. The problems can be found at this link https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-regexp.html

> ## Problem Set 3: Web Applications
>This problem set is for you to learn the fundamentals of creating a web application in Go. Create a single Git repository as >your submission, complete with README and gitignore files. NB: after completing each exercise, commit your code - there should >be at least one commit per exercise. You be will required to submit a URL to the repository and the use of GitHub is >recommended for this purpose. All code should be fully commented, and the README should explain how to clone your repository >and run the code.

>## 1. Guessing game
>Create a web application in Go that responds with the text “Guessing game”. This should be the response body irrespective of >what request is received. Explain in your README how to examine the response, including the headers, using curl.

>## 2. Make the text a H1
>Change your web application to make “Guessing game” a level 1 heading in HTML. Test your application, making sure that the >HTML is rendered by your browser. If it isn’t, fix it.

>## 3. Serve a page using Bootstrap
>Change the web application to serve a web page rather than hard-coding the text into the web application executable. Use the >Bootstrap starter template, changing the header to say “Guessing game”. Add a link on the page to the relative URL /guess with >the text “New game”. Have this page served as the root resource in the web application.

>## 4. Add a guess route
>Create a new route in your application at /guess. Have it serve a new page called guess.html. Use the same Bootstrap code for >the page as in index.html but add a level 2 heading with the text “Guess a number between 1 and 20”. Add a form, with a text >input with the name “guess” and a submit button with the label “Guess”. The action of the form should be /guess and the method >should be GET.

>## 4. Turn the guess page into a template
>Change the web application to use the guess.tmpl file as a template. Add a single variable to the template called Message and >create a struct in Go containing a single string. Create an instance of the struct with the string set to “Guess a number >between 1 and 20” and have the template render this in the H2 tag.

>## 5. Check for a cookie
>In the /guess handler check if the cookie called target is set. If it is not, generate a random number between 1 and 20 and >set a cookie called target to that value in the response. Otherwise, leave the cookie at its current value.

>## 6. Check for a variable
>Have the /guess handler check if a URL encoded variable called guess has been set to an integer. If it has, have the text “You >guessed {guess}.” inserted into the template where {guess} is replaced with the value of guess.

>## 7. Compare the cookie and the guess
>If the target cookie and the guess variable are both set, then have the /guess handler compare them. If they are equal, set >the target cookie to another randomly generated integer, and have the template display a congratulations message and a link to >create a new game. Otherwise, have the template display a message telling the user what their guess was and whether it was too >high or too low.

>## 8. Use the POST method
>Change your HTML form in guess.html to use the POST method instead. Make sure your application still works, bug fixing it if >necessary.
